HOW TO WRITE A JIT COMPILER IN 30 MINUTES
==========================================

     * Antonio Cuni, PyPy core dev

     * http://github.com/antocuni/jit30min

     * *VERY* simple JIT compiler for x86_64

     * Subset of Python

     * All variables are assumed to be of type `float`

     * *DISCLAIMER*

         - I have never written any assembly before
